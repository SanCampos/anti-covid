<h4>Hello! Thank you for logging in as a PasaHero!</h4>
<h6 align="justify">
	Who are the PasaHeroes? They are the frontliners. They are the people who need transportation which may take the form of jeeps, buses, vans, etc. The path that these vehicles take are called routes. PasaHeroes upload documents into their account which validate their identity and their place of work so that the Admin can properly review their request to join the route. Once a PasaHero has joined a route, he or she can provide his or her preference for the time of departure of the vehicles that will transport them from their residence to their place of work. This will be processed by the Admin as the basis for route availability and capacity. <br><br>
	To experience the site as a PasaHero, click "Documents" to upload a document or click "Join Routes" to join a route.
